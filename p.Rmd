## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
>>>>>>> 47f453ed8df4fe0a7f8012936e0dab55cbec7eac

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
x=rep(0,1000)
y=rep(0,1000)

for (i in seq_along(1:1000)) {
  
  x[i] = mean(rpois(1000,2))
  
  y[i] = sum(rpois(1000,2))
  
}

plot(density(x))



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}


plot(density(y))
